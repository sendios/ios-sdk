 Sendios iOS SDK.
 
 Use the Sendios SDK to design and send push notifications,
 track and report events occurred in your application.
 
 Developers using the Sendios SDK with their app are required to register for
 a credential, and to specify these credentials (appId, clientId, clientToken) in their application.
 Failure to do so results in blocked access to certain features and degradation
 in the quality of other services.
 
 To obtain these credentials, visit the developer portal at https://api.sendios.io/dev
 and register for a license.
 
 - Note: Credentials are unique to your application's bundle identifier.
 Do not reuse credentials across multiple applications.
 
 Adding Credentials
 
 Ensure that you have provided the appId, clientId, clientToken before using the Sendios SDK.
 For example, set them in your app delegate:
 
 ```
 func application(_ application: UIApplication,
 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    Sendios.initializeWithLaunchOptions(launchOptions, appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',  clientToken: 'YOUR_APP_CODE')
 }
 ```
 */

     - Parameters:
        - launchOptions: A dictionary indicating the reason the app was launched (if any). The contents of this dictionary may be empty in situations where the user launched the app directly.

        - clientId: Sendios SDK Client Id obtained from developer portal at https://api.sendios.io

        - appVersion: Application version
